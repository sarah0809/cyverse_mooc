Downloading data from the Discovery Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. 	#### Comment: Step title should be descriptive (i.e. Cleaning Read data) ###


1. If necessary, log into the CyVerse |Discovery Environment|.

2. Click the |Data Icon| (Data Icon) to browse your collection of files in the
   CyVerse Data Store.

3. In the top left of the page, you should see your username with a dropdown
   arrow next to it; Click on your username, then click Community Data in the
   dropdown menu.

    .. tip::

       This dropdown menu allows you to navigate between your home directory
       in the Data Store (i.e. your username), and other CyVerse data
       collections such as files shared with you (i.e. "Shared with Me"), and
       files shared by the CyVerse community (i.e. "Community Data"). You may
       also access files located in your "Trash" folder.

4. Select **Community Data** and navigate to the folder which will contain our
   example data:

   :download:`/iplant/home/shared/cyverse_training/cyverse_mooc/XXXXXX`

5. Click (Select) the checkbox next to the folder to select that file.


6. Click on the **More Actions** button on the upper right and select the
   **Download** option to download the file to your local computer.

   .. tip::

      We don't recommend downloading many (more than 10) or large (more than
      2GB) files directly from the Discovery Environment since files transferred
      in this way will make use of HTML protocols which are slow and subject to
      failure for very large data sets. Cyberduck or iCommands (discussed below
      and in the |Data Store Guide|) are recommended for these uses.
