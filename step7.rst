*Editing Metadata on Single Files in the Discovery Environment*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. If necessary, log into the CyVerse |Discovery Environment|.

  2. Click the |Data Icon| (Data Icon) to browse your collection of files in the
     CyVerse Data Store.

  3. Navigate to the **tutorial_folder** and select (checkbox) the
     **DE_sample_plants.fas** file uploaded previously.

  4. Under the **More Actions** menu, click on the **`Metadata`** choice.
     You will see existing metadata for the file/folder in the Attribute,
     Value, Unit (AVU) format.

*Adding metadata*
  1. Click the “+ Add Metadata” button to add a new entry. Then follow the
     directions for editing metadata below.

*Editing or deleting metadata*

  1. Use the “pencil” icon to edit an existing entry or the “trash can”
     icon to delete an entry.

  2. After you have made any edits or deletion, click ‘Save’ (on the top right
     of the screen) to save all entries and apply the metadata.


*Apply metadata on multiple files in the Discovery Environment*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to add or edit metadata on multiples files in the Discovery Environment by uploading a spreadsheet with this metadata. The spreadsheet can be designed to follow a metadata format or standard, or contain whatever metadata entries you want associated with a set of files. See the |Metadata documentation in the Data Store Guide| for more details.


**Output/Results**

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Output
      - Description
      - Example
    * - A *DE_sample_plants.fas* file with metadata applied
      - Metadata associated with a file uploaded to the CyVerse Data Store is
        now made searchable by the metadata attributes.

  5. Next, under ‘Permissions’ choose what permission you want to grant the
     person you are sharing this file with.
